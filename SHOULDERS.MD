# On the Shoulders of Giants

This project wouldn't be possible without the hard work of MANY other people and projects.  In no particular order:

* [GopherJS](https://gopherjs.org)
* [Vecty](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty)
* [gopherwasm](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherwasm)
* [dom](https://honnef.co/go/js/dom)
* [go-humble](https://github.com/go-humble/router)
* [html2vecty](https://jsgo.io/dave/html2vecty)
* [jennifer](https://github.com/dave/jennifer)
* [gorilla](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)
* [dom](https://github.com/yml/go-js-dom)

To make this project work, we had to fork many of these fine projects to support Web Assembly.  Where that was necessary, the forks are at [the gowasm org on Github](https://github.com/gowasm).

We're extremely grateful to Richard Musiol, Dave Brophy, Dmitri Shuralyov, Hajime Hoshi, Paul Jolly, and Stephen Gutekanst from the GopherJS community for all the hard work behind the GopherJS family of projects.
